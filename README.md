# ISP-HVP-Shield

Arduino ISP and HVSP/HVPP Shield for ATtiny Microcontoller

## Preface

**This repository is discontinued and only provided for others to further work
with its content.**

Eagle CAD version 7 was used to create the schematic and board files. The latest
version I've tested was Eagle CAD v7.7. I do not support the price and product
policy of Autodesk and therefore have moved from Eagle CAD to the free and open
source KiCad. I can only recommend you to do the same.

## Revision 1.0

This is the original version of the Arduino ISP shield which not only has been
successfully tested but also copied/created by various other users.

**If you are unsure which version to use for further experiments stick to this
one.**

## Revision 1.1

This was a slightly improved version of the original ATtiny ISP Shield.
This version was *never produced and never tested* as real hardware.


## Revision 2.0

This was an experimental revision which not only should allow the programming
of ATtiny microcontollers but also erase their fuses (via high voltage
programming).

The TopoR autorouter was used to route the v2.0 board which then was used to
generate the Gerber files. I've added an ripped-up version of the board for
compatibility reasons.
