Arduino ISP and HVSP/HVPP Shield

This repository is discontinued and only provided for others to further work with its content.
Eagle CAD version 7 was used to create the schematic and board files. The latest version I've tested was Eagle CAD v7.7.
The TopoR autorouter was used to route the v2.0 board.

I do not support the price and product policy of Autodesk and therefore moved from Eagle CAD to the free and open source KiCad. I can only recommend you to do the same.
